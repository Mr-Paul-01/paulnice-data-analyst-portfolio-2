    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a results-oriented and highly analytical Junior Data Analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Sydney, where I graduated with honors and consistently achieved top grades in data-related coursework.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Project 1: Customer Segmentation for XYZ Retailers</h3>
    <p>
      At XYZ Retailers, I led a team in building a customer segmentation model to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior. The project involved extensive data cleaning and preprocessing of transaction data, followed by exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to extract relevant features. Leveraging unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and hierarchical clustering, we successfully identified five customer segments with distinct purchasing patterns, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

    <h3>Project 2: Predictive Maintenance for ABC Manufacturing</h3>
    <p>
      At ABC Manufacturing, I played a key role in implementing a predictive maintenance solution for critical machinery on the production floor. I worked closely with the maintenance team to gather sensor data from machines and preprocess it for predictive modeling. By employing machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we developed an accurate predictive maintenance model that detected anomalies and potential failures in real-time. This proactive approach led to a significant reduction in unplanned downtime and increased machinery uptime, saving the company substantial maintenance costs.
